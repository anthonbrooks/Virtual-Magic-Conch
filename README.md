# Virtual-Magic-Conch

***Magic Conch***

For my final project for **Intro to Python** I chose to expand the chatbot from Assignment 3. 

My chatbot is a 'Virtual Magic Conch' similar to the 'Magic Conch Shell' from SpongeBob. If you do not know what the 'Magic Conch' is, it is like a 'Magic 8-Ball', a device that you can ask a question. 

To use the 'Magic 8-Ball' you ask a question then shake the 'Magic 8-Ball' for an aswer to "magically" appear.

For the 'Magic Conch Shell', SpongeBob asks a question then pulls a string on the shell and the shell speaks an answer.

These devices have a few set responses, so I created functions that recognize different types of questions and return an answer depending on the input. 

Start out by saying 'hello'.

Enjoy and ask away, and if you want a laugh, ask the 'Virtual Magic Conch' to tell you a joke.
